# NaijaDeals Handoff — Phase 00 & Phase 01

## Verification Baseline Summary (Phase 00)

**Phase:** 00 — Verified baseline and recovery  
**Workspace:** C:\Users\User\Documents\naijadeals.com  
**Branch:** naijashop-marketplace  
**Remote:** github-preservation → https://github.com/naijadeals001-hash/NaijaDeals_AI_Build.git  
**Last Commit (Phase 00):** 884faecc "Phase 00 UI/UX corrections"  
**Last Commit (Phase 01):** c53d8bb "Add hosting, deployment & operations capabilities: Docker, CI/CD, docs"  
**Stash Backup:** `Phase00-backup-before-audit` (git stash)  
**Preview URL:** http://localhost:3000 (development via `npm run dev`); build artifact `.next/` produced by `npm run build`  

## Phase 00 Files Created

| File | Purpose | Evidence |
|------|---------|----------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Master project rules | 24 rules documented |
| `docs/architecture.md` | System architecture overview | 50+ models; 10 verticals; API surface; auth/payment flow |
| `docs/requirements-matrix.md` | Requirements coverage by status | 30+ requirements mapped |
| `docs/decisions.md` | Decision log with rationale | 10 documented decisions |
| `docs/phase-tracker.md` | Phase progression tracking | All phases mapped; Phase 00 PASS |
| `docs/handoff.md` | Phase exit summary | Preserves baseline; documents changes |

## Phase 01 Files Created

| File | Purpose | Evidence |
|------|---------|----------|
| `docs/hosting-comparison.md` | Hosting research and cost comparison | 3 options analyzed; pilot vs production |
| `docs/deployment-plan.md` | Deployment procedures | Docker, CI/CD, rollback, security |
| `docs/operations-runbook.md` | Operations procedures | Backups, incidents, maintenance |
| `Dockerfile` | Multi-stage build for Next.js | Standalone output; Alpine base |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Local development stack | App + PostgreSQL |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | Production deployment | Secrets management, health checks |
| `.dockerignore` | Build optimization | Excludes dev/secret files |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | CI pipeline | Type-check, lint, build, test, Docker |
| `next.config.mjs` | Next.js config update | Added output: "standalone" |

## Key Findings (Phase 01)

1. **Hosting Options Identified:**
   - **Pilot (Lowest Cost):** Self-managed VPS (~$5-10/mo) — high operational burden
   - **Production (Better Resilience):** Vercel + Neon/Supabase (~$40+/mo) — managed, scales well, good African latency via edge
   - **Hybrid:** Single VPS with managed DB (Supabase/Neon) — balanced cost/ops

2. **Deployment Readiness:**
   - Build passes with `output: "standalone"` (verified via `npm run build`)
   - Docker multi-stage build produces minimal production image
   - CI/CD pipeline validates type-check, lint, build, tests before Docker build
   - Rollback procedure documented (revert to previous image tag)

3. **Operations:**
   - Backup strategy: daily pg_dump to off-server storage
   - Secrets management via Docker secrets (prod) / env files (local)
   - Health checks on both app and DB containers
   - TLS via Let's Encrypt (documented in runbook)

4. **Security:**
   - No credentials in repo (`.env`, `.env.txt`, `.env.local` in `.gitignore`)
   - Production uses Docker secrets for sensitive data
   - Firewall rules and SSH hardening documented
   - Non-root containers

## Verification Evidence

- **Build:** `npm run build` ✅ (standalone output verified at `.next/standalone/`)
- **Type-check:** `npm run type-check` ✅
- **Git Push:** Remote SHA `c53d8bb31e48bdffaf0f857183ae7e10f0f77926` confirmed matching local
- **No secrets committed:** Verified via `git diff` and `.gitignore` check

## Remaining Work

**Phase 02A** — Design system: accessible color and typography tokens (per AGENTS.md rule 23)

## Authorization Boundaries

- **No purchases made** — hosting research only
- **No domain registration** — documented for future
- **No production DNS changes** — documented for future
- **No production deployment** — configuration prepared only
- **No production data migration** — documented procedure only
